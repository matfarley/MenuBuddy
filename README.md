An iPhone app created in colaboration with Amanda Bishop as part of her Masters of Interdisciplinary Art and Design.
The app is a simplistic recipe based app that breaks down steps into timed blocks, in order to assist unskilled cooks, 
or recent home leavers.  Features include a countdown timer and text to speak.  

Future iterations will be matched with an online service and voice command.
